-> There are four Display Properties in CSS:
    Block, Inline, Inline-Block, Flex, None
Display Properties are the things which can we respresent our elements in the screen.

2. Display-Block?
-> It will take the width and height specified to them. It is automatic because Div is a block level element. It will try to keep elements in new line

3. Display-Inline?
->It will take the space how much is required of the content and we cannot set manual height and width, even if we set it will not be applied.

4. Display-Inline-Block?
-> It is a combination of inline and block property.

5. Display-none?
-> It will make the content vanished and it will not contain height and width specified to the box.

6. Display-flex?
->By default it will dispay in row.
